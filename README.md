Guess the Word! It's a game! Try it! ✨

Guess the Word is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It's a game that starts with a word on the screen, where circle symbols act as placeholders for each letter. 
Players start by entering a letter, and if they guess correctly, the letter appears in the word. 
If the player's guess is incorrect, the number of remaining guesses displays on the page. 
Letters that have already been guessed remain visible on the page for the player to track, 
and, depending on what the player enters, if the letter has already been guessed, or it's a non-alphabetic character, 
the player will be told they already guessed that letter, or that they need to enter a leter A-Z.
A player wins if all the correct letters have been guessed before reaching the allotted guesses.
When a player wins, they will be congratulated!
At the end of the game, a new Play Again button appears, allowing the player to choose to play another round. 

add an API call to fetch a text file with over 800 of the most common English words. Your game will then randomly select a word from the file, so each time the player visits, they’ll likely get a new word to guess!
